# CODESOFT
Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! Within this repository, you'll discover a compilation of projects that I've successfully accomplished during my internship at Codsoft. These projects exemplify my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and innovative problem-solving. Below, I provide a summary of these projects:

# PROJECTS
1. Predicting Survival on the Titanic
   Project Overview: This project delves into the Titanic dataset to make predictions about passenger survival. It encompasses activities such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and constructing a machine learning model to estimate survival probabilities.

2. Iris Flower Species Classification
   Project Overview: The Iris Flower Classification project represents a quintessential machine learning task. It entails the utilization of the Iris dataset to categorize iris flowers into distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

3. Sales Prediction with Python
   Project Overview: This project revolves around the prediction of sales for a business. It entails processes such as data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the formulation of a predictive model intended to forecast future sales.

4. Detecting Credit Card Fraud
   Project Overview: The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is designed to create a machine learning model for identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. This project addresses the challenge of class imbalance, performs data preprocessing, and leverages logistic regression for classification.
